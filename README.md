# Oracle-SQL-Developer
These reports are written for the purpose of
1. Making my day-to-day DBA activities quicker and more efficient.
2. Create reports for my manager to help her/him get a quick update on the status of Database Inventories and customer issues.
3. Trend database growth, backup status, transactional loads of various databases
4. Generate information, reports such as AWR, ASH, ADDM, AWR (SQL), ASH (SQL) etc. for performance issues reported to Oracle (via SR)
And a lot more.

I will be adding more to the README to help better understand usage of my Scripts.
